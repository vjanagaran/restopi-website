# RestoPi Complete Project Context

## Business Context

### The Origin Story
RestoPi started when founder's friend was 3 days from shutting down his restaurant. Not because food was bad or customers didn't come, but because he was flying blind. Every decision was a guess. In one weekend, they made his restaurant intelligent using data. Three months later, he opened his second restaurant. Today he runs three. He's home for dinner with his kids.

### Mission
Make 10,000 restaurant owners profitable enough to have a life, not just a business.
